# 3DprintFractals
3D print 2D fractals.


Python programs that generate Gcode files for FDM 3D printer.

## Dragon curve
The Gcode simply draw in only one layer the dragon curve up to $n$ iterations.

## Peano curve
Peano's curve may be constructed by a sequence of steps.
The Gcode produce at every layer an iteration of the proceeding.

## Pentaflake
As for the Peano curve, every layer rapresent an iteration of the construction.

## Siepinski Tiangle

## Koch Snowflacke



## Use
``$ python3 file.py -> GcodeFile.gcode``
